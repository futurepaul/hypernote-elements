can you write me a few very simple test cases for me? I'll be using the bun test framework

they should be hypernote language documents, with a yaml frontmatter and markdown content as defined in README.md

and the output should be a valid nostr event, as defined in OUTPUT.md

let's start really simple hello world stuff, like an h1 and a button in a form that posts a hardcoded "hello world" note
