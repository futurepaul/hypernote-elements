# Hypernote Examples

This directory contains example Hypernote documents in both source (.md) and compiled (.json) formats.

Each example demonstrates different features of the Hypernote language:

- **basic-hello**: Basic heading and form with hardcoded event
- **styled-heading**: Heading with ID and applied style rules
- **form-with-input**: Form with input and template variable usage
- **query-and-loop**: Query definition with loop iteration
- **complex-feed**: Complex example with pipeline query, styling, and nested forms
- **component-example**: Component definition with imports and conditional rendering

## File Structure

For each example `example-name`:
- `example-name.md` - The source Hypernote Markdown
- `example-name.json` - The compiled JSON output

These files are used by the test suite to ensure consistency between input and output.
